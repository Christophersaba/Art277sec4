<!--This is my harder -->
<p><b> Dear Mr. Momo </b></p>
<p> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study<br> as part of your PHD next year. I will answer your question one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<h1>starting dates</h1>
<!--This is my harder -->
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit<br>us better if you could start at the beginning of the semester; the start date for each are as <br> follows:</p><br>
<p>First semester: 9 October 2022<br>
Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>
Third semester: 2 May 2023</p><br>
<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
<p>you can find more information about important University dates on our website</p>
<h1>Subject of study </h1>
<!--This is my harder -->
<p>At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-mineded research facility-as long as the subjects<br> fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. you seen like an intelligent, dedicated<br> researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas<br> you submitted we were most intrigued by as follows, in order of priority:</p> <br>
<p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), <br> when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>4.</sup>) </p> <br>
<p><strong>HTML</strong>and <strong>CSS</strong>constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
 <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd <br>expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd <br>need to know? Thanks.</p>
 <h1>Exotic dance move</h1>
<!--This is my harder -->
 <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, i did study exotic tribal dances. To </p><br> answer your question, my favorite dance are as follows, with definition:
 <p>Polynesian chicken dance
 <ol d="no-list-style-type"> <br>
 <il>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole village</il> <br> 
 would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"</il></ol>
 <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
 <ol d="no-list-style_type">
   <il>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice<br> this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling<br> their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my follo <brdent used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking. <br><il> </ol>
   <!--This is my harder -->
   <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
   <ol d="no-list-style-type">
     <il>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in 1960s <br>believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robot", stilted<br> movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on <br>however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really<br>cold. </il></ol></p>
       <p2>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p2>
       <p3>Yours sincerely,</p3>
